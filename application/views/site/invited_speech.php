                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The aim of Future Internet is to provide 24/7/365 satisfactory secure connectivity for everyone and everything which will bring changes in the society and industry. To achieve this goal, researchers are working to improve existing Radio, Core, and Management technologies and adding new concepts and technologies like Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Cloud Computing, Fog Computing / Internet of Things (IoT), Cyberphysical Systems, Industrial Internet (for example, Industry 4.0), and Big Data. All of these technologies and concepts together will drive the Future Internet.</p>
