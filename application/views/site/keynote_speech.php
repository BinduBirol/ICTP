                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this keynote, we will review the recent trends and advancements in optical signal and image recognition techniques followed by the development of a photorefractive material basedtechnique for single/multiple object-relatedsignal detection and tracking. Each detection/tracking algorithm utilizes various properties of objectrelated signals in a given sequence. The data fusion algorithm employs complementary features of two or more of these algorithms to achieve significantly better detection/tracking accuracy. Test results using real life signals/imagery will be presented to verify the effectiveness of the data fusion technique.This technique can be effectively used for various practical applications such as face recognition, finger print identification, character recognition, and related applications.</p>
