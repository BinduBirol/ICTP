                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The evolving fifth generation (5G) cellular wireless networks are envisioned to provide higher data rates, enhanced end-user quality-of-experience (QoE), reduced end-to-end latency, and lower energy consumption. Starting with the visions and requirements for 5G cellular networks, I will present several emerging technologies, which will enable and define the 5G mobile communications standards. I will discuss the major research problems, which these new technologies breed in the context of 5G systems.</p>

He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of Victoria, Canada, in 2001. Dr. Hossain&#8217;s current research interests include design, analysis, and optimization of wireless/mobile communication networks with emphasis on 5G systems, cognitive and green radio systems, and network economics. He was elevated to an IEEE Fellow &#8220;for contributions to spectrum management and resource allocation in cognitive and cellular radio networks&#8221;. Currently, he serves as the Editor-in-Chief for the <em>IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials</em> and an Editor for <em>IEEE Wireless Communications</em>. Also, he is a member of the IEEE Press Editorial Board. He has won several research awards including the IEEE Communications Society Transmission, Access, and Optical Systems (TAOS) Technical Committee’s Best Paper Award in IEEE Global Communications Conference 2015 (Globecom’15),University of Manitoba Merit Award in 2010 and 2014 for Research and Scholarly Activities, the 2011 IEEE Communications Society Fred Ellersick Prize Paper Award, and the IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference 2012 (WCNC&#8217;12) Best Paper Award. Dr. Hossain is a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Communications Society (2012-2015). He is a registered Professional Engineer in the province of Manitoba, Canada.</p>
