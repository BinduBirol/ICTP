                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Summary: </strong>Energy harvesting (EH) has attracted considerable attention from academia and industry as an environmentally friendly supply of energy for the wireless communication nodes. In practice, the transmitter and receiver nodes in communication systems expend their energy for processing and transmitting data. Connecting these transceiver nodes to the power grid is cumbersome for some applications and in other cases, may not even be possible. In these situations, deploying EH nodes is an alternative solution. EH nodes harvest energy from the renewable sources of their surrounding environment, convert it to electrical energy, and store the electrical energy in batteries in order to carry out their functions. In general, the energy can be harvested from unused ambient renewable energy sources using solar, thermoelectric, and motion effects, or through other physical phenomena. EH nodes can be regarded as a promising option for deployment as they ensure a long system lifetime without the need for periodic battery replacements.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Developing new systems or modifying the existing protocols to accommodate the EH capability while controlling communication resources brings many new challenges not only in physical layer but also in higher layers. This tutorial will explore into the design and optimization problems for EH systems and delve into their performance analysis. Starting with the visions and requirements for EH systems, the challenges of radio resource control and allocation (e.g., power control, subcarrier allocation, user scheduling, etc.) will be outlined. Open research issues and possible approaches to tackle those issues will be described. Furthermore, an organization of the related literature addressing the different aspects of EH systems will be provided highlighting the different methodologies adopted for analysis and optimization of EH networks.</p>
