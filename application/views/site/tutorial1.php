                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Summary:</strong> To meet the explosive demands of high-capacity and broadband wireless access, modern cell-based wireless networks have trends of continuous increase in the number of cells and utilization of higher frequency bands. It leads to a large amount of base stations (BSs) to be deployed; therefore, cost-effective BS development is a key to success in the market. In order to reduce the system cost, radio over fiber (RoF) technology has been proposed by various researchers.<br />
                            Ultra-wideband radio over fiber (URoF) is a novel technology in the field of short-range communication applications. The main goal is to enable range extension of 1 to 3 orders of magnitude over a typical UWB radio signal in the range of 3.1-10.6 GHz. URoF&#8217;s technology will allow the separation of low cost Base-Station (BS)s from the Central-Station (CS). The main differences between URoF and the conventional RoF are in the RoF technology, which targets the 3G/4G cellular systems, the RF signal bandwidth is only a few 10&#8217;s of MHz and its average power is in the range of several 100mW. This requires high cost photonic components in the CS and medium cost components in the BS. URoF is targeting the Personal Area Network (PAN) market that is characterized by very low cost and low power (10&#8217;s Î¼W) access point. In URoF, the optical fiber is used to carry extremely wide RF signals (several GHz).</p>

He then joined as a post doctoral fellow (94-95), Research Engineer (95-98) at the Center for Electrophotonics Materials and Devices, at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. He moved to the University of Toronto, Canada as Senior Research Associate (1998-2000). In March 2000 he joined as an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering, in the Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Denver and Promoted to Associate Professor with tenured in the Fall of 2006. He published more than 160 journal, conference proceedings and posters. He is a senior Member of IEEE, OSA &amp; SPIE and member of ASEE and Sigma Xi. His research interest is in Optoelectronic Materials, Devices ((PV and Sensors) and Communications such as OFDM, RoF and wireless. He is the Director Photovoltaics and Photonics lab, University of Denver.</p>
